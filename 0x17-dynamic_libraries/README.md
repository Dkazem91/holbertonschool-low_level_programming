# 0x17. C - Dynamic libraries

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What is a dymanic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
* What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
* What are the differences between static and shared libraries
* Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig

**Exercises:**

**0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life**

    Create the dynamic library libholberton.so containing all the functions listed below:

**1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future**

    Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

**2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing**

    Write a blog post describing the differences between static and dynamic libraries. It should cover:

* Why using libraries in general
* How do they work
* How to create them (Linux only)
* How to use them (Linux only)
* What are the differences between static and dynamic libraries
* What are the advantages and drawbacks of each of them

Your posts should have examples and at least one picture, at the top. Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn, and share it at least on Twitter and LinkedIn.
